This project is done during the Asian Leadership Programme 2016, between SUTD and ZJU in Hangzhou, China. The theme of the project is Music Emotion, and our team decided to develop a web application, UWAFFLE

### The idea
UWAFFLE was made to help travelers explore the music in the places they visit through a web application. Music is a way to connect with people, but language can be a barrier. With UWAFFLE, music can be discovered based on the people around you, even if it is in a language you don't understand. 

Music Emotion is a theme that targets the effects of music on emotions and vice versa. In the initial weeks of the Asian Leadership Programme (ALP), our group mentor, Professor Zhang, introduced us to his research students in Zhejiang University (ZJU), and also briefed us on the existing equipment they used in their research. The ZJU students presented us with many creative ideas that brought in plants, electrical signals from muscles and music composition algorithms. After giving us a glimpse of the possibilities in this theme, Professor Zheng split us into three groups so that we could all brainstorm and work on our ideas before pitching them against each other, eliminating one group in the process. 

In the beginning, my team was simply generating ideas individually then putting them together for comparison. Our ideas were lacking in both depth and width, however, after several meetings with the teaching assistants, we managed to develop our ideas well enough to call them our “child”. Some of our initial ideas included a smart home-plant solution, a location and photo based shuffling playlist, and social networking platform that bonds neighbours through shared gardens. Short stories were crafted to better explain how our product would be used in each situation, and all these ideas were document into a static html file that I made.
 
Eventually after doing more research on the open-sourced materials, we proposed our idea and did not get eliminated. From there, we had two new members and began working on the development of our project. It was this period where we realised all the challenges that were coming our way as we tried to develop this location based shuffling music player smart phone application. 

Having only the experience from one term of Python programming, we had absolutely no knowledge in developing mobile applications. This was our first and biggest hurdle, to become familiar enough with a new programming language, and produce a working prototype in the short span of two months. With time running against us, we emailed our digital world professors back in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and did our fair share of research. We spent slightly more than a week exposing all the platforms available to make this happen, including softwares and frameworks like Android Studios, the Ionic framework, Django as well as Xcode.

After experimenting with all these, we settled on making a web application instead of a native mobile application. This meant that we had to give up on certain functions that would only work on a native mobile application, but keeping in mind our limited resources, a web application was the best option. Having prior knowledge in Python, we thought that the Django framework would suit our needs best, hence we spent some time trying to understand and apply it. 

Django, being a high-level framework, took a long time to pick up, and we were not producing results as we had planned in our timeline. Therefore, another meeting was called, where we put on the table all that we’ve learnt and where we should go from there. It was then we decided to proceed without Django, using PHP, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and Javascript (JS). 

From there, we divided our workload into the video team, back-end and front-end developers. I was part of the front-end team, along with Michelle, where I translated her designs into HTML, CSS and JS. Then begins the continuous process and experimentation, research and a lot of learning. Other than the syntax of these languages, I was also opened up to many functions achievable through them. I think this knowledge is really valuable. 

The familiarity through examples helps to make imagined functions more concrete, and I was less afraid to experiment with new things. An illustration of this would be the time Kai Lue and I was trying to link the album art to the songs displayed. Both of us being unfamiliar with JS struggled to make sense of what ever we found on Github. However, having seen several examples of the applications of JS, we slowly altered little bits of code and eventually figured it out. This knowledge would then help us in functions added later on, such as displaying the name of the user who added the songs.

At the end of it, I would say that the whole design process involves a lot of reluctant moments of elimination. We spent a lot of time learning and experimenting with things that would eventually be removed from the project, such as the use of the Django framework as well as the attempts to understand the Swift language in Xcode. Though it was difficult to remove them after having place so much effort into learning it, I realised that ultimately it was for the better. 

The idealistic goal was slowly refined to something more realistic and achievable with our limited time. Rather than giving up, I think this is a lesson of flexibility. To be able to make changes and adapt according to there main aim and problems we had on hand, is a really essential quality we had as a team. At the same time, I am also glad we persisted on several things instead of changing our plans every time we met with a problem. To be able to do this, the communication between team members was vital, as we had to be we were all on the same page in terms of our goals. 

The importance of communication was reinforced in the last few weeks of the program, where most of our code was already uploaded to the server. This was where we were troubleshooting and making changes simultaneously, opening up the risk of deleting progress if we did not communicate clearly. 

In the ultimatum, the entire process of this project taught me not only new programming languages, but also important skills in team work as well as the value of experimentation and research. The past three months gave me invaluable experiences that I believe would help me in future projects as well.
